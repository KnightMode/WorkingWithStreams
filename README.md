# WorkingWithStreams

Solved the below 3 problem statements using Streams:

1)**Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.**

`For example:`

`Given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17,`

`return true since 10 + 7 is 17.`

2)**Given an array of N integers,**

**You have to find the probability of choosing a random pair(i, j), i < j such that A[i] + A[j] is maximum.**

`For Example:`
`Input : A[] = {1, 2, 2, 3}`

`Output : 0.3333`

`Explanation :`

`Here, maximum sum we can get by selecting a pair is 5.`

`Total number of pairs possible = 6.`

`Pairs with maximum sum = {2, 3} and {2, 3} = 2.`

`Probability = 2/6 = 0.3333`

3)**Given an array of integers,**
**Return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.**

`For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].`

**Note:The above can be implemented easily without division but the approach shown here has been done without the use of division**
